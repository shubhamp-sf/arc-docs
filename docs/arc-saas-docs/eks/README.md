SourceFuse Reference Architecture to implement a EKS multi-tenant software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution. The purpose of this document is to give the architecture design specifics that will bring insight to how a Saas solution using **ARC** is structured, organized and works internally. SourceFuse has developed a demonstration EKS SaaS solution aimed at illustrating the key architectural and design principles essential for constructing a multi-tenant SaaS platform on AWS. This example serves as a practical reference for developers and architects seeking to implement best practices in their own projects. The programming model, cost efficiency, security, deployment, and operational attributes of EKS represent a compelling model for SaaS providers.
