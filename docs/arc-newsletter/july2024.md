#### ARC SaaS

1. **Managing Control-Plane Applications with ArgoCD GitOps** : Optimizing Control-Plane Application Management with ArgoCD GitOps using Terraform. This helps in monitoring the health of micro-services of control-plane while making it easy to update control-plane features or roll back deployments. Helping to streamline and accelerate deployment cycles.

#### ARC IaC

1. **Automating AWS CodePipeline with Terraform**: Our terraform [ci/cd](https://github.com/sourcefuse/terraform-aws-arc-cicd) module automates the creation of AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild projects, enabling seamless build and deployment for both application code and Terraform modules. By establishing reusable CodeBuild projects, it ensures consistent, efficient build processes shared across multiple CodePipelines. This standardized approach reduces redundancy and enhances configuration simplicity in CI/CD pipelines.

2. **Simplified ElastiCache Management**: The [cache](https://github.com/sourcefuse/terraform-aws-arc-cache) module streamlines the deployment and management of AWS ElastiCache clusters, supporting both Redis and Memcached options. This Terraform module offers a unified solution for creating and configuring ElastiCache components, including parameter groups, subnet groups, and security groups, ensuring efficient cluster setup and configuration.

#### ARC API

1. **Enhanced Audit Log Archival**: Our updated [audit-log](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sourceloop/audit-service) service now supports archiving logs based on lists of 'actedOn' and 'actionGroup' instead of a single string, enabling easier grouping and simultaneous archiving of related entities. This enhancement reduces the number of archives, improving performance when retrieving archived data.
