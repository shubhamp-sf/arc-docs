#### ARC IaC

1. **ECS Module Upgrade**: The [ECS module](https://github.com/sourcefuse/terraform-aws-arc-ecs) has been upgraded to support EC2-backed ECS clusters alongside AWS Fargate. This enhancement gives you the flexibility to choose between Fargate for a fully managed, serverless experience or EC2 for greater control, customization, and potential cost savings.

#### ARC API

1. **Enhanced File Upload**: Our [file upload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sourceloop/file-utils) package now supports multi-file uploads, making bulk uploads faster and hassle-free. Additionally, we've integrated [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) for antivirus scanning, ensuring your system stays protected from potential threats.
